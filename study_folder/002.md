## Binary Search Trees

The data in the Binary Search Trees (BST) is always stored in such a way that the values in the left subtree are always less than the values in the root node and the values in the right subtree are always greater than the values in the root node, i.e. left subtree < root node â‰¤ right subtree.

The main disadvantage of Binary Search Trees is that if all elements in nodes are either greater than or lesser than the root node, the tree becomes skewed. Simply put, the tree becomes slanted to one side completely.

This skewness will make the tree a linked list rather than a BST, since the worst case time complexity for searching operation becomes O(n).

To overcome this issue of skewness in the Binary Search Trees, the concept of Balanced Binary Search Trees was introduced.
